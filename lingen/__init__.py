Lingen. v0.2b
-------------

see README ?

== TODO ==

[ ] Remove "Simulator" from ProgramRunState (simulator can run
    multiple programs)
    
[ ] Abstract Function class interfaces and default functionality and make it
    easier to create more customized and flexible functions
    
[ ] Alternative to very fixed options in the settings stuff. Modules? Hooks?
    Modifiers? (move some stuff to a new simulator maybe?)

[ ] Implement something much nicer, cleaner, and less silly than the
    reduce_weights() functionality
    
[ ] Add a larger and more user-friendly interface in World().

[ ] Implement more of the basic functions such as math stuff (trig, sqrt, etc),
    more conditionals, more operators, register ops (swap or someth?)
    
[ ] Create a way to set up a world and additional program functionaility with
    just class (hooks or callbacks for custom Functions). Simulation, running,
    etc all in here
